## Description:

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Installation:

npm install

## Usage:

- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
-Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
